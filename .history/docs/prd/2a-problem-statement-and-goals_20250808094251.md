# 2a. Problem Statement & Goals

## Problem Statement
P2P crypto trading today is fragmented, trust-reliant, and difficult for mainstream users. Buyers and sellers face counterparty risk, opaque pricing, prolonged escrow disputes, and inconsistent compliance experiences across regions. Existing DEXs lack P2P-friendly workflows; existing P2P platforms are custodial or centralized.

## Product Goals (Chronological, MVP-first)
- MVP (0–3 months): Enable safe, ICP-native P2P swaps with clear UX, minimal off-chain dependencies, and manual dispute process.
- Phase 2 (4–6 months): Improve UX, expand features, and prepare limited cross-chain via ICP integrations.
- Phase 3 (7–12 months): Scale ecosystem, expand multi-crypto support, and mature automation/security.

## Non-Goals (MVP)
- Broad multi-chain support beyond ICP-native path
- Fully automated on-chain adjudication of disputes
- Advanced DeFi features and derivatives

## Value Hypothesis
If we provide a trust-minimized, mobile-first P2P trading UX on ICP with predictable settlement and clear dispute paths, mainstream and privacy-conscious users will adopt it for direct trading.

## Success Criteria (High-level)
- MVP KPIs met or exceeded (see 12.4)
- Sufficient liquidity and retention to validate product-market fit
- Security and compliance sign-offs for target jurisdictions

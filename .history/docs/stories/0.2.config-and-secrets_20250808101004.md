# Story 0.2: Config & secrets

## Status

Draft

## Story

As a developer, I want a clear config/secrets structure (.env.example and loaders), so that OAuth, IPFS, and canister IDs can be configured safely without code changes.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `.env.example` lists required variables for OAuth providers, IPFS, and ICP canister IDs. [Source: architecture/external-apis.md#kyc-provider-apis] [Source: architecture/external-apis.md#ipfs-api]
2. App loads config through a single configuration layer; secrets are not committed. [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
3. Config keys and usage are documented in `README.md`. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Create/update `.env.example` with: OAUTH_PROVIDER_KEYS, IPFS_NODE_URL, IPFS_GATEWAY_URL, CANISTER_IDs per canister, etc. (AC: 1) [Source: architecture/external-apis.md]
- [ ] Implement config loader abstraction in Flutter and reference from ICP service. (AC: 2) [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#frontend-services-layer]
- [ ] Document config variables, required values, and rotation strategy in `README.md`. (AC: 3)

## Dev Notes

- Tech selection implies multiple external APIs (KYC, Chainlink, CoinGecko, IPFS); list their keys/URLs explicitly. [Source: architecture/external-apis.md]
- Avoid direct environment access; use config objects. [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]

## Testing

- Smoke test: app initializes when config is present; fails gracefully with actionable error when missing. [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]

# Story 0.2: Testing baseline

## Status
Ready for Dev

## Dependencies

- 0.1 Repo & CI baseline

## Story

As a developer, I want a testing baseline and folder structure so that unit, widget, and integration tests are easy to add and run in CI.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Test folders created: `test/unit/`, `test/integration/`, `test/e2e/` (e2e optional). [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]
2. Sample widget test at `test/unit/widgets/sample_widget_test.dart` passes locally and in CI. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-examples]
3. CI runs `flutter test --reporter expanded` and surfaces failures. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]

### BDD Scenarios

- Scenario: Sample widget test passes in CI
  - Given the sample widget test exists at `test/unit/widgets/sample_widget_test.dart`
  - When CI runs `flutter test --reporter expanded`
  - Then the test passes and failures are surfaced by CI

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Create folders `test/unit/`, `test/integration/`, `test/e2e/`. (AC: 1)
- [ ] Add `test/unit/widgets/sample_widget_test.dart` using provided widget test pattern. (AC: 2)
- [ ] Ensure CI step executes tests and surfaces failures. (AC: 3)
- [ ] Document how to run tests locally in `README.md`. (AC: 3)

## Dev Notes

- Use example tests from the strategy doc to validate setup. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-examples]

## Testing

- Ensure the sample widget test runs headless in CI and passes (path: `test/unit/widgets/sample_widget_test.dart`). [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-examples]

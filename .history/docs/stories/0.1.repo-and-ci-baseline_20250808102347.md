# Story 0.1: Repo & CI baseline

## Status

Draft

## Story

As a developer, I want a consistent repo setup with automated CI (build, lint, test), so that every change is validated and quality remains high.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. On every PR, CI runs Flutter build and tests; failures block merge. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]
2. Linting and formatting checks run in CI; violations fail the pipeline. [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
3. Commit style is standardized and documented in the repo (README or CONTRIBUTING). [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#naming-conventions]
4. CI configuration is versioned under `.github/workflows/`. [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#monorepo-structure]

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions workflow to run `flutter pub get`, `flutter analyze`, and `flutter test`. (AC: 1, 2) [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]
- [ ] Add formatter/linter step (Dart format/analyze) and fail on issues. (AC: 2) [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- [ ] Document commit message and branching conventions in `README.md`. (AC: 3)
- [ ] Cache Flutter dependencies to reduce CI time. (AC: 1)
- [ ] Badge/summary in `README.md` referencing CI status. (AC: 1)

## Dev Notes

- Use Testing Strategy structure to ensure tests run predictably in CI. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]
- Enforce coding standards (Result handling, validation conventions) via analyzer rules. [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- Place workflows under `.github/workflows/flutter.yml`. [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#monorepo-structure]

## Testing

- A seeded widget test must run and pass in CI to validate the baseline. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-examples]

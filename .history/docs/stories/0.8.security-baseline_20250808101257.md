# Story 0.8: Security baseline

## Status

Draft

## Story

As a developer, I want baseline security practices (input validation, principal handling, rate limiting notes), so that early features are built on secure defaults.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Documented input validation patterns for UI and canister calls are adopted. [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
2. Principal handling and auth guard patterns documented and enforced in service layer. [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#authentication-architecture]
3. Non-functional security requirements referenced and tracked. [Source: prd/5-non-functional-requirements.md#5.2-security-requirements]

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Write a short security checklist for devs (repo doc). (AC: 3)
- [ ] Implement input validation helpers and integrate with forms/service calls. (AC: 1)
- [ ] Add auth guard utilities and principal checks in service layer. (AC: 2)

## Dev Notes

- Follow coding standards for validation, rate limiting, and principal security. [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- Reuse backend auth guard concepts on the client side where applicable. [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#authentication-architecture]

## Testing

- Unit tests for validators and auth guard utilities. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]

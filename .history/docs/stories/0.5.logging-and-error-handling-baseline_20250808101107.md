# Story 0.5: Logging & error handling baseline

## Status

Draft

## Story

As a developer, I want consistent logging and error handling patterns in frontend and canister calls, so that failures are diagnosable and user-facing errors are consistent.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Frontend logger utility exists and is used in auth/marketplace flows. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
2. Canister Result handling pattern is implemented in service layer; errors mapped to typed domain errors. [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
3. Common error UI is available for display in screens. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#flutter-app-structure]
4. Debug log path honored for dev agents per core-config (`.ai/debug-log.md`). [Source: .bmad-core/core-config.yaml]

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Create `lib/core/logger/logger.dart` with levels and sinks. (AC: 1)
- [ ] Implement Result handling helpers for canister calls. (AC: 2) [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#authentication-architecture]
- [ ] Add shared error dialog/snackbar widgets and integrate. (AC: 3) [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#flutter-app-structure]
- [ ] Append key debug entries to `.ai/debug-log.md` in dev builds. (AC: 4)

## Dev Notes

- Follow coding standards for error and input validation. [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- Use component structure for error UI from `shared/widgets/`. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#flutter-app-structure]

## Testing

- Unit tests for error mapping; widget test for error UI rendering. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]

# Story 0.4: App structure alignment

## Status

Draft

## Story

As a developer, I want the Flutter app folders, routes, and providers aligned with the architecture, so that teams can navigate and extend features consistently.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Directory structure under `lib/` matches `features/`, `core/`, and `shared/` guidance. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#flutter-app-structure]
2. Initial routes scaffolded and documented: `/login`, `/register`, `/home`. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#routing-architecture]
3. Any deltas from the monorepo structure are documented in this repo. [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#monorepo-structure]

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Ensure presence of `lib/features/auth/`, `lib/features/marketplace/`, `lib/shared/`, and `lib/core/blockchain/`. (AC: 1) [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#flutter-app-structure]
- [ ] Define base routes `/login`, `/register`, `/home` with placeholder screens. (AC: 2) [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#routing-architecture]
- [ ] Document structure and any deviations in `README.md`. (AC: 3)

## Dev Notes

- Follow the proposed feature-module structure and Riverpod provider placement. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management-architecture]
- This repo is a single Flutter app; capture the divergence from the monorepo in notes. [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#monorepo-structure]

## Testing

- Verify app builds and can navigate `/login` → `/register` → `/home` without runtime errors. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]

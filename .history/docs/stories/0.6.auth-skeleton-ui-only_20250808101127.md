# Story 0.6: Auth skeleton (UI-only)

## Status

Draft

## Story

As a user, I want to see basic login and registration screens and protected route behavior, so that the initial navigation and UX are in place before wiring backend.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `RegisterScreen` and `LoginScreen` exist with form validation; no backend calls. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#flutter-app-structure]
2. Protected route component redirects unauthenticated users to login. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#routing-architecture]
3. Navigation routes are defined and accessible. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#routing-architecture]

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Create `RegisterScreen` with validators; `LoginScreen` with placeholders. (AC: 1)
- [ ] Add `ProtectedRoute` widget and apply to protected screens. (AC: 2)
- [ ] Wire routes in router with placeholders for profile/home. (AC: 3)

## Dev Notes

- Follow example route and protected route patterns. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#routing-architecture]
- Align screen locations under `lib/features/auth/screens/`. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#flutter-app-structure]

## Testing

- Widget tests: validation messages, protected route redirection. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]

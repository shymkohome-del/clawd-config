# Story 0.7: Testing baseline

## Status

Draft

## Story

As a developer, I want a testing baseline and folder structure so that unit, widget, and integration tests are easy to add and run in CI.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Test folders exist for unit, integration, and (optional) e2e per strategy. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]
2. A sample widget test exists and passes locally and in CI. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-examples]
3. CI runs `flutter test` and reports results. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Create test folders and seed sample tests. (AC: 1, 2)
- [ ] Ensure CI step executes tests and surfaces failures. (AC: 3)
- [ ] Document how to run tests locally in `README.md`. (AC: 3)

## Dev Notes

- Use example tests from the strategy doc to validate setup. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-examples]

## Testing

- Ensure the sample widget test runs headless in CI and passes. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-examples]

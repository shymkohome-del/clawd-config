# Story 8.1: Observability baseline (telemetry and error tracking)

## Status
Draft

## Dependencies

- 0.6 Logging & error handling baseline
- 0.8 Security baseline

## Story

As an operator, I want baseline observability so that I can monitor health, errors, and performance across app and canisters.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Given the mobile app runs, when errors occur, then they are captured in Crashlytics with breadcrumbs. [Source: architecture/monitoring-and-observability.md#monitoring-stack]
2. Given canisters process requests, when metrics are emitted, then key metrics are recorded (memory, cycles, request/error rates). [Source: architecture/monitoring-and-observability.md#key-metrics]

### BDD Scenarios

- Scenario: Frontend error capture
  - Given a handled error occurs
  - When the error handler runs
  - Then an event is sent to Crashlytics

- Scenario: Canister metric tracking
  - Given the marketplace canister serves traffic
  - When requests exceed threshold
  - Then alerts are raised (manual review for MVP)

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Frontend: Integrate Crashlytics and performance monitoring (AC: 1) [Source: architecture/monitoring-and-observability.md#monitoring-stack]
- [ ] Backend: Implement basic canister metrics and logs (AC: 2) [Source: architecture/monitoring-and-observability.md#key-metrics]
- [ ] Error handling alignment per strategy (AC: 1) [Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md#error-flow]

## Dev Notes

- Metrics to track include API latency, error rate, cycle consumption, and memory usage. [Source: architecture/monitoring-and-observability.md#key-metrics]

## Testing

- Verify:
  - Simulated errors appear in Crashlytics
  - Canister log/metric counters reflect traffic and errors

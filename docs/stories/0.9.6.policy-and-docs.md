# Story 0.9.6: Policy and documentation

## Story

As a maintainer, I want policy guardrails and documentation so that contributors understand the automation and changes are reviewed properly.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `CODEOWNERS` protects `.github/workflows/**` and related scripts; PRs touching them require review from the DevOps/Owners group.
2. `docs/development-workflow.md` documents branch naming, story file rules, auto‑merge gates, and feature flags.
3. PR template reminds authors about story status and naming, including `Status: Done` requirement for `story/*` auto PR.

## Dependencies

- 0.9.5 Reusable and testable design

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Add/update `CODEOWNERS` file to protect workflow files.
- [ ] Update `docs/development-workflow.md` with detailed sections for the automation and debugging tips.
- [x] Add `.github/pull_request_template.md` with reminders and links.

## Testing

- Open a PR touching a workflow and verify required reviewers are requested automatically.

| YYYY‑MM‑DD | 0.1 | Initial draft | Scrum Master |
| 2025-08-19 | 0.2 | QA: Sync — CODEOWNERS and PR template missing; docs update pending; Status InProgress. | QA |

## Dev Agent Record

- Implemented:
  - `.github/CODEOWNERS` protects workflows, scripts, and story docs
  - `.github/pull_request_template.md` added with policy reminders
- Pending:
  - Update `docs/architecture/development-workflow.md` with flags, gating, troubleshooting

## QA Results

- AC1 — CODEOWNERS: Pass. `.github/CODEOWNERS` protects workflows/scripts and docs/stories.
- AC2 — Documentation: Partial. PR policy is present in template; `docs/architecture/development-workflow.md` still needs expansion.
- AC3 — PR template: Pass. `.github/pull_request_template.md` added with required reminders.

Verdict: Keep `Status: InProgress`. Documentation update pending to complete the story.

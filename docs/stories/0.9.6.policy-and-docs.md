# Story 0.9.6: Policy and documentation

## Story

As a maintainer, I want policy guardrails and documentation so that contributors understand the automation and changes are reviewed properly.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `CODEOWNERS` protects `.github/workflows/**` and related scripts; PRs touching them require review from the DevOps/Owners group.
2. `docs/development-workflow.md` documents branch naming, story file rules, auto‑merge gates, and feature flags.
3. PR template reminds authors about story status and naming, including `Status: Done` requirement for `story/*` auto PR.

## Dependencies

- 0.9.5 Reusable and testable design

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Add/update `CODEOWNERS` file to protect workflow files.
- [ ] Update `docs/development-workflow.md` with detailed sections for the automation and debugging tips.
- [ ] Add `.github/pull_request_template.md` with reminders and links.

## Testing

- Open a PR touching a workflow and verify required reviewers are requested automatically.

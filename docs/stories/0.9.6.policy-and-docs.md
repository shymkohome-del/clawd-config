# Story 0.9.6: Policy and documentation

## Story

As a maintainer, I want policy guardrails and documentation so that contributors understand the automation and changes are reviewed properly.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `CODEOWNERS` protects `.github/workflows/**` and related scripts; PRs touching them require review from the DevOps/Owners group.
2. `docs/development-workflow.md` documents branch naming, story file rules, auto‑merge gates, and feature flags.
3. PR template reminds authors about story status and naming, including `Status: Done` requirement for `story/*` auto PR.

## Dependencies

- 0.9.5 Reusable and testable design

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Add/update `CODEOWNERS` file to protect workflow files.
- [x] Update `docs/development-workflow.md` with detailed sections for the automation and debugging tips.
- [x] Add `.github/pull_request_template.md` with reminders and links.

## Testing

- Open a PR touching a workflow and verify required reviewers are requested automatically.

## Dev Agent Record

- Implemented:
  - `.github/CODEOWNERS` protects workflows, scripts, and story docs
  - `.github/pull_request_template.md` added with policy reminders
  - Fixed `.github/CODEOWNERS` duplicate patterns; ensured `@maintainers @devops` are the effective owners for workflows/scripts; added explicit co-owners for `docs/stories/*`.
- Pending:
  - None

## QA Results

- AC1 — CODEOWNERS: Pass. `.github/CODEOWNERS` effectively requires `@maintainers @devops` on workflows/scripts; stories co-owned.
- AC2 — Documentation: Pass. `docs/architecture/development-workflow.md` documents branch policy, story gating, auto‑merge gates, error taxonomy, troubleshooting, local preflight, and feature flags.
- AC3 — PR template: Pass. `.github/pull_request_template.md` includes branch policy, Status: Done reminder for `story/*`, and CI/merge policy.

Verdict: All ACs Pass. Set `Status: Done`.



## Additional: Consistency & Test Plan

- CODEOWNERS enforcement:
  - Open a PR that touches `.github/workflows/**` and `scripts/**`; verify required reviewers are auto-requested.
- Documentation coverage:
  - Ensure `docs/architecture/development-workflow.md` includes: branch taxonomy, story gating rules, flags (`AUTO_PR_ENABLED`, `AUTO_MERGE_ENABLED`, `AUTO_APPROVE_ENABLED`), retry/taxonomy, and troubleshooting.
- PR template effectiveness:
  - Validate checkboxes/reference sections guide authors to set `Status: Done` for `story/*` and reference the story ID.
- Links hygiene:
  - All links in docs resolve within the repo; run a link checker job or manual verification.

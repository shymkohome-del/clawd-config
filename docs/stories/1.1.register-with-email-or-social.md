# Story 1.1: Register with email/social

## Status
Done

## Dependencies

- 0.5 ICP service layer bootstrap
- 0.7 Auth skeleton (UI-only)
- 0.6 Logging & error handling baseline
- 0.8 Security baseline

## Story

As a new user, I want to register with email or social, so that I can access the marketplace.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Given valid email/social, when I submit, then an account is created and I am signed in. [Source: prd/4b-user-stories-and-acceptance.md#e1-user-identity]
2. Given registration completes, when mapping occurs, then an ICP principal is associated with my account. [Source: prd/4b-user-stories-and-acceptance.md#e1-user-identity]

### BDD Scenarios

- Scenario: Successful email registration
  - Given a valid email, password, and username
  - When I submit the registration form
  - Then an account is created, I am signed in, and my ICP principal is mapped to my user profile

- Scenario: Failed registration due to invalid input or provider denial
  - Given an invalid email or OAuth provider denial
  - When I attempt to register or login via social
  - Then I see appropriate error messages and I am not signed in

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

No previous stories exist. This is the first story in Epic 1. [Source: prd/4a-epics-and-capabilities.md#epic-e1-user-identity]

### Data Models

- User model fields required for this story include `id: Principal`, `username`, `email`, `authProvider`, `reputation`, `createdAt`, `lastLogin`, `isActive`, `kycVerified`, `profileImage?`. The critical linkage is principal mapping upon registration/login. [Source: architecture/data-models.md#user-model]

### API Specifications

- User Management Canister interfaces: `register(email, password, username) -> Result<User, Text>`, `loginWithOAuth(provider, token) -> Result<User, Text>`, `getUserProfile(user: Principal) -> ?User`. Principal mapping must be present in returned `User`. [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#icp-candid-interface]

### Component Specifications

- UI: `RegisterScreen` and optional social login entry on `LoginScreen` within `lib/features/auth/screens/`. Shared widgets under `lib/shared/widgets/` can be used for inputs and error display. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#flutter-app-structure]
- Backend: User Management Canister implements registration, OAuth login, and principal mapping. [Source: architecture/components.md#user-management-canister]

### File Locations

- Frontend app structure places auth screens under `lib/features/auth/screens/` with providers in `lib/features/auth/providers/`. Service calls via `lib/core/blockchain/icp_service.dart` (or equivalent ICP service layer). [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#flutter-app-structure]

### Testing Requirements

- Organize Flutter tests under `test/unit` for form validation and `test/integration/screens` for registration flow. Implement example patterns shown in the strategy doc. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]
- Add canister unit tests for user creation and principal mapping in `canisters/user_management/test/`. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]

### Technical Constraints

- Follow tech stack versions: Dart 3.4+, Flutter 3.22+, flutter_bloc 8.x. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- Enforce coding standards: never mutate state directly; handle Result types; validate inputs; validate caller principal in canister functions. [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]

### Core Workflows

- Registration flow sequence and OAuth flow must match documented steps, including principal mapping and returning user profile. [Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#user-registration-flow] [Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#oauth-login-flow]

### Project Structure Notes

- The architecture’s unified monorepo structure references `apps/mobile` and `canisters/*`, whereas this repository currently contains a single Flutter app under `lib/` and no canister code. Align paths for Flutter features as above. Canister interfaces are treated as external services per current repo; integration via ICP service layer should abstract canister calls. [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#monorepo-structure]

## Testing
Review
- Unit/widget tests verifying:
  - [x] **Localization: Implement multi-language support for registration form labels, validation messages, error states, and success messages using Flutter's internationalization (i18n) framework.**
  - OAuth initiation triggers provider flow and handles success/failure.
  - Error states rendered for invalid inputs and backend errors.

## Change Log

| 2025-08-26 | 0.5 | Completed localization subtasks; verified localized error mapping; formatted code; analyzer/tests PASS; backend principal mapping pending → Status remains InProgress | Dev |
| 2025-08-26 | 0.6 | QA review: AC1 Pass; AC2 Fail — principal mapping still missing; Status kept InProgress | QA |
  - Requested changes:
    - AC2: Implement User Management canister `register`, `loginWithOAuth`, and principal mapping; return `User` with `id: Principal`.
    - AC2: Add canister unit tests covering user creation and principal association; include negative tests for invalid input and provider denial.
  - Recommendations:
  - Add an integration shim in `ICPService` to surface a placeholder `principal` field in the success path once backend is available; guard behind feature flag.
  - Provide `canisters/user_management/user_management.did` stub and wire Candid types to unblock frontend typing.
| 2025-08-26 | 0.7 | Implemented principal shim behind `FEATURE_PRINCIPAL_SHIM`; updated `AuthService` to return `User` with `id` principal; added Candid DID stub; added unit test for shim; analyzer/tests PASS; Status remains InProgress pending real canister and canister tests | Dev |
| 2025-08-26 | 0.8 | QA review: AC1 Pass; AC2 Partial — principal surfaced via shim and shown on Home; backend canister principal mapping still missing → Status kept InProgress | QA |
  - Requested changes:
    - AC2: Implement User Management canister `register`/`loginWithOAuth` with real principal mapping and return `User { id: Principal }` from backend.
    - AC2: Add canister-side unit tests for user creation, principal association, and negative cases (invalid inputs, provider denial).
  - Recommendations:
    - Keep `FEATURE_PRINCIPAL_SHIM` disabled in non-dev builds; add an E2E check ensuring principal display only when the flag is enabled.
| 2025-08-26 | 0.9 | Implemented Motoko canister `user_management` with principal mapping, persistence, and input validation; added Candid sync, ic-repl tests, and `dfx.json`; Flutter analyzer/tests PASS; set Status to Review | Dev |
  - Backend details:
    - Canister persists `User` keyed by caller `Principal`; maps email→principal; validates email/password/username; supports OAuth login with provider variant; stable storage with pre/post upgrade.
    - Added basic ic-repl test covering successful register, duplicate email error, OAuth path, and profile fetch.
  - Frontend remains feature-flagged for principal shim; wiring to real actor can be enabled via ICP service when environment is ready.

## QA Results
Acceptance review (2025-08-25):
- AC1 — Pass: Email and social (Google/Apple) flows create an account and sign in, navigating to Home on success. Evidence: `RegisterScreen` listener routes on `AuthSuccess`; `ICPService.register/loginWithOAuth` return success; unit/widget/integration tests cover submit, progress state, navigation, and OAuth initiation.
- AC2 — Fail: Principal mapping is not implemented. No backend canister code exists; `ICPService` stubs don’t perform mapping or return a `User` with principal; no tests assert mapping after registration/login.

Acceptance review (2025-08-26):
- AC1 — Pass: Static analysis clean; all unit/widget/integration tests pass. Email and social flows sign in and navigate to Home; i18n verified for labels/errors.
- AC2 — Fail: Backend principal mapping still absent. No canister implementation or tests; `ICPService` remains stubbed without returning a `User` containing the caller principal.


Acceptance review (2025-08-26):
- AC1 — Pass: Registration and OAuth flows succeed; navigation to Home confirmed by tests. Principal display on Home verified in integration test when shim is enabled.
- AC2 — Partial: Principal is surfaced via frontend shim (`FEATURE_PRINCIPAL_SHIM`) and passed through Auth success to the Home screen. However, no real canister implementation exists; principal mapping is not persisted or validated server-side.

Acceptance review (2025-08-26):
- AC1 — Pass: Static analysis clean; all unit/widget/integration tests pass. Email and social flows sign in and navigate to Home; i18n verified for labels/errors.
- AC2 — Pass: Backend principal mapping implemented in `canisters/user_management` (Motoko). `register`/`loginWithOAuth` return `User` with `id: Principal`; ic-repl test covers register, duplicate email, OAuth login, and profile fetch. Mapping requirement satisfied.

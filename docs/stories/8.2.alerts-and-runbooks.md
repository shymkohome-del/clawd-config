# Story 8.2: Alerts and lightweight runbooks

## Status
Ready for Review

## Dependencies

- 8.1 Observability baseline

## Story

As an operator, I want basic alert thresholds and response playbooks so I can react quickly to incidents.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Given observability is integrated, when error rate or latency exceeds thresholds, then an alert is raised (manual or Slack stub for MVP). [Source: architecture/monitoring-and-observability.md#key-metrics]
2. Given alerts fire, when I open runbooks, then I see steps to triage common issues. [Source: docs/architecture/monitoring-and-observability.md]

### BDD Scenarios

- Scenario: Error rate spike
  - Given error rate > threshold
  - When the condition persists for N minutes
  - Then an alert is raised

- Scenario: Latency regression
  - Given p95 latency > threshold
  - When observed for N minutes
  - Then an alert is raised

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Define thresholds and alert conditions (AC: 1) [Source: architecture/monitoring-and-observability.md#key-metrics]
- [ ] Create minimal runbook docs for top issues (AC: 2)
- [ ] Wire a basic alert channel (Slack/email stub) (AC: 1)

## Dev Notes

- Keep thresholds conservative for MVP; refine after telemetry data. [Source: architecture/monitoring-and-observability.md#key-metrics]

## Testing

- Verify:
  - Synthetic error spike triggers alert
  - Runbooks are discoverable and actionable

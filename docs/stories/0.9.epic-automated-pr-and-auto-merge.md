# Epic 0.9: Fully automated, reliable PR creation and auto‑merge flow

## Goal

Create a zero‑touch workflow that opens PRs to `develop`, gates on status/branch rules, enables auto‑merge reliably, and is idempotent, observable, and testable.

## Non‑goals

- Release pipelines
- Build distribution

## Phases

1. Phase 0 — Stabilize and make failures impossible to miss (`0.9.1`)
2. Phase 1 — Deterministic PR creation (no gh CLI) (`0.9.2`)
3. Phase 2 — Auto‑merge that actually merges (`0.9.3`)
4. Phase 3 — Reliability hardening (`0.9.4`)
5. Phase 4 — Reusable and testable design (`0.9.5`)
6. Phase 5 — Policy and docs (`0.9.6`)
7. Phase 6 — Guardrails and quality gates (`0.9.7`)
8. Phase 7 — Cleanup and metrics (`0.9.8`)

## Story

As a repo maintainer, I want our PR automation to be deterministic, resilient, and safe so that contributors get fast feedback and merges happen automatically when policies are satisfied.

## Acceptance Criteria (Epic)

1. All phase stories `0.9.1`–`0.9.8` are Delivered and validated by QA.
2. A successful demo shows: linting blocks bad YAML, deterministic PR creation without duplicates, auto‑merge enabled and executed when checks pass, retries/backoff for transient failures, reusable workflow + self‑tests, documented policies, guardrails for branch/title/story presence, and post‑merge cleanup + metrics.

## Dependencies

- 0.1 Repo & CI baseline

## BDD Scenarios (Epic)

- Scenario: Zero‑touch PR lifecycle
  - Given a push to a valid branch (`feature/*` or `story/*` with `Status: Done`)
  - When the automation runs
  - Then a PR is created or reused deterministically, auto‑merge is enabled, and the PR merges when required checks pass

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Deliver phase `0.9.1` — Workflow lint + flags
- [ ] Deliver phase `0.9.2` — Deterministic PR creation (no gh)
- [ ] Deliver phase `0.9.3` — Auto‑merge enablement + repo settings alignment
- [ ] Deliver phase `0.9.4` — Retries/backoff, error taxonomy, observability
- [ ] Deliver phase `0.9.5` — Reusable workflow and self‑tests
- [ ] Deliver phase `0.9.6` — CODEOWNERS, docs, PR template
- [ ] Deliver phase `0.9.7` — Guardrails and quality gates
- [ ] Deliver phase `0.9.8` — Post‑merge cleanup and metrics

## Dev Notes

- The operating workflow today is `.github/workflows/auto-pr-from-qa.yml`. Changes should maintain idempotency and backward compatibility while flags are off.
- Prefer REST/GraphQL calls over `gh` to avoid runner dependencies.

## Testing

- End‑to‑end demo on a test repo branch shows: deterministic PR creation → auto‑merge scheduled → merge on green → branch cleanup → metrics summary.

## QA Results

- 2025-09-10T13:24:21Z — Workflow PR Lint failed with conclusion: failure. [View logs](https://github.com/Vitalion/crypto_market/actions/runs/17615230192).
- 2025-09-11T06:04:28Z — Workflow PR Lint failed with conclusion: failure. [View logs](https://github.com/Vitalion/crypto_market/actions/runs/17635551170).hat no development work is lost and develop becomes the complete source of truth for all completed features.

## Background

There are currently **10 local unmerged branches** and **4 remote unmerged branches** that contain completed work but haven't been integrated into develop:

**Local Unmerged Branches (10):**
1. `chore/backlog-merge-20250906` - Backlog integration work
2. `chore/codex-backlog-merge-20250905` - Codex backlog integration  
3. `feat/workflow-improvements-and-stories` - Workflow enhancements
4. `story/0.13-codex-cloud-multi-language-tooling` - Multi-language tooling
5. `story/0.2-testing-baseline` - Testing infrastructure
6. `story/0.2-testing-baseline-ci-fixes` - CI testing fixes
7. `story/0.6-logging-and-error-handling-baseline` - Logging framework
8. `story/0.6-logging-and-error-handling-baseline-codex` - Codex logging integration
9. `story/0.7-auth-skeleton-ui-only` - Authentication UI
10. `story/0.9.9-system-consistency-and-validation` - System validation

**Remote Unmerged Branches (4):**
11. `origin/story/0.2-testing-baseline` - Remote testing baseline changes (1 commit ahead)
12. `origin/story/0.6-logging-and-error-handling-baseline-codex` - Remote codex logging changes (1 commit ahead)  
13. `origin/story/0.7-auth-skeleton-ui-only` - Remote auth UI changes (1 commit ahead)
14. `origin/story/0.14-develop-branch-consolidation` - Current story branch (1 commit ahead)

**Conflict Resolution Strategy**: When merge conflicts occur, **accept develop changes** to maintain develop as the authoritative branch while preserving any unique work from feature branches.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Branch Inventory Complete**: All 10 local unmerged branches and 4 remote unmerged branches are identified and assessed for merge readiness.

2. **Systematic Merge Process**: Each branch is merged into develop following the established priority order with proper conflict resolution.

3. **Conflict Resolution Strategy**: When merge conflicts occur, **develop branch changes take precedence** - conflicts are resolved by accepting develop's version while preserving any unique functionality from the feature branch.

4. **Code Quality Maintenance**: After each merge, CI checks (flutter analyze, dart format, flutter test) pass without errors.

5. **Work Preservation**: Any unique functionality from feature branches that would be lost due to conflict resolution is documented and manually integrated if valuable.

6. **Branch Cleanup**: Successfully merged local branches are deleted to maintain repository hygiene.

7. **Remote Branch Integration**: Remote branches with unique commits are fetched and merged into develop using the same conflict resolution strategy.

8. **Integration Validation**: Full test suite passes after all merges are complete, ensuring no functionality is broken.

9. **Documentation Update**: User stories corresponding to merged branches are marked as completed and any new functionality is documented.

## Tasks / Subtasks

### Phase 1: Pre-Merge Assessment
- [x] Document current state of develop branch as baseline
- [x] Check each of the 10 branches for commit count and potential conflicts:
  - [x] `chore/backlog-merge-20250906`
  - [x] `chore/codex-backlog-merge-20250905`
  - [x] `feat/workflow-improvements-and-stories`
  - [x] `story/0.13-codex-cloud-multi-language-tooling`
  - [x] `story/0.2-testing-baseline`
  - [x] `story/0.2-testing-baseline-ci-fixes`
  - [x] `story/0.6-logging-and-error-handling-baseline`
  - [x] `story/0.6-logging-and-error-handling-baseline-codex`
  - [x] `story/0.7-auth-skeleton-ui-only`
  - [x] `story/0.9.9-system-consistency-and-validation`

### Phase 2: Systematic Branch Merging (Priority Order)
- [x] Merge `chore/codex-backlog-merge-20250905` (likely largest impact)
- [x] Merge `chore/backlog-merge-20250906` 
- [x] Merge `feat/workflow-improvements-and-stories`
- [x] Merge story branches in numerical order (0.2, 0.6, 0.7, 0.9.9, 0.13)
- [x] For each merge: Run `git merge <branch>` and resolve conflicts by accepting develop changes
- [x] Run CI checks after each merge: `flutter analyze && dart format --set-exit-if-changed . && flutter test`

### Phase 3: Conflict Resolution and Validation
- [x] For each conflict: Use `git checkout --ours <file>` (accept develop version)
- [x] Manually review any unique functionality that might be lost
- [x] Preserve valuable unique code by manual integration after conflict resolution
- [x] Test functionality after each merge to ensure no regressions

### Phase 4: Remote Branch Integration
- [x] Fetch latest remote branches: `git fetch origin`
- [x] Merge `origin/story/0.2-testing-baseline` (1 commit ahead)
- [x] Merge `origin/story/0.6-logging-and-error-handling-baseline-codex` (1 commit ahead)
- [x] Merge `origin/story/0.7-auth-skeleton-ui-only` (1 commit ahead)
- [x] Merge `origin/story/0.14-develop-branch-consolidation` (current story updates)
- [x] Apply same conflict resolution strategy: accept develop changes, preserve unique value
- [x] Run CI checks after each remote merge

### Phase 5: Cleanup and Documentation
### Phase 5: Cleanup and Documentation
- [x] Delete successfully merged local branches: `git branch -d <branch-name>`
- [x] Update story status for completed user stories
- [x] Document any functionality that was preserved vs. discarded during conflict resolution
- [x] Final full test suite run and CI validation

## BDD Scenarios

- **Scenario: Merge with conflicts - accept develop changes**
  - Given a feature branch with changes that conflict with develop
  - When the merge is performed using `git merge <branch>`
  - And conflicts occur in files
  - Then conflicts are resolved by accepting develop version (`git checkout --ours <file>`)
  - And any unique valuable functionality is manually preserved after resolution
  - And CI checks pass after the merge

- **Scenario: Successful merge without conflicts**
  - Given a feature branch that doesn't conflict with develop
  - When `git merge <branch>` is executed
  - Then the merge completes automatically
  - And CI checks pass without manual intervention
  - And the branch can be safely deleted

- **Scenario: Complete consolidation validation**
  - Given all 10 local branches have been merged
  - When the full test suite is executed
  - Then all tests pass without regressions
  - And develop contains all valuable functionality from the merged branches
  - And the repository has clean branch hygiene

## Dev Notes

- **Conflict Resolution Priority**: Always accept develop changes when conflicts occur - develop is the source of truth
- **Manual Preservation**: After resolving conflicts, manually review and integrate any unique valuable functionality that was overwritten
- **Branch Order**: Merge chore branches first (likely biggest impact), then story branches in logical order
- **Testing After Each Merge**: Run CI checks after each merge to catch issues early
- **Documentation**: Update corresponding user story status as branches are merged
- **Git Commands**: 
  - Merge: `git merge <branch-name>`
  - Resolve conflicts: `git checkout --ours <conflicted-file>`
  - Delete merged branch: `git branch -d <branch-name>`

## Testing

- Run CI suite after each individual merge: `flutter analyze && dart format --set-exit-if-changed . && flutter test`
- Full regression testing after all merges complete
- Manual testing of key workflows to ensure no functionality lost during conflict resolution
- Validation that all user stories work as expected after consolidation

## Estimated Effort

- **Complexity**: Medium (10 branches, clear conflict resolution strategy)
- **Time Estimate**: 1-2 days (depending on conflict frequency and complexity)
- **Risk Level**: Low (clear strategy, develop takes precedence, valuable work manually preserved)
- **Required Skills**: Git merge operations, conflict resolution, manual code integration

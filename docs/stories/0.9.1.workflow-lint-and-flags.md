Title: Story 0.9.1 — Workflow lint and feature flags
Status: InProgress

# Story 0.9.1: Stabilize and make failures impossible to miss

## Story

As a repo maintainer, I want workflows to fail fast on syntax/format issues and to be toggleable via flags, so that riskier automation can be enabled/disabled without code changes and broken YAML never ships silently.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A required check named "Workflow Lint" runs before other jobs and fails on any YAML/action issues using `actionlint` and `yamllint`.
2. All bash steps run with `set -euo pipefail`; missing env/vars cause failures with clear messages.
3. Feature flags via repo variables: `AUTO_PR_ENABLED`, `AUTO_MERGE_ENABLED` (default true when unset). Toggling flags enables/disables behavior without code changes.
4. Any YAML mistake blocks the workflow with a clear, actionable error message.

## Dependencies

- 0.1 Repo & CI baseline

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Add job `workflow-lint` to `.github/workflows/auto-pr-from-qa.yml` running:
  - `uses: actions/checkout@v4` (pinned)
  - Install `actionlint` and `yamllint` (pinned versions) and run against `.github/workflows/**.yml`.
  - Mark this job as a required status check named "Workflow Lint" in repo settings.
- [x] Enforce `set -euo pipefail` in all bash `run:` blocks within the workflow.
- [x] Introduce flags by gating subsequent jobs/steps with `${{ vars.AUTO_PR_ENABLED != 'false' }}` and `${{ vars.AUTO_MERGE_ENABLED != 'false' }}`.
- [x] Add clear echo messages when a flag disables behavior (non‑failing, with rationale).

## BDD Scenarios

- Scenario: Lint blocks invalid YAML
  - Given a malformed workflow YAML is committed
  - When the `workflow-lint` job runs
  - Then the job fails with a clear error and no subsequent jobs run

- Scenario: Flags disable automation without code changes
  - Given `AUTO_PR_ENABLED` is set to `false`
  - When the workflow runs on a valid branch
  - Then PR creation steps are skipped with a clear note in logs

## Testing

- Commit a deliberately malformed YAML change in a branch and observe `workflow-lint` fails and blocks.
- Set repo variable `AUTO_PR_ENABLED=false` and verify PR creation step is skipped; set back to `true` and verify it runs.

| Date | Version | Description | Author |
| ---- | ------- | ----------- | ------ |
| YYYY‑MM‑DD | 0.1 | Initial draft | Scrum Master |
| 2025-08-18 | 0.2 | QA: Changes requested — mark "Workflow Lint" as a required status check in repo settings to fully satisfy AC1 | QA |

## Dev Agent Record

- Implemented:
  - Added `Workflow Lint` pre-job in `.github/workflows/auto-pr-from-qa.yml`
  - Added separate PR-triggered `workflow-lint.yml`
  - Enforced `set -euo pipefail` in bash steps
  - Feature flags added: `AUTO_PR_ENABLED`, `AUTO_MERGE_ENABLED`, `AUTO_APPROVE_ENABLED`
  - Added explicit flag note job when `AUTO_PR_ENABLED=false`
- Pending:
  - Mark "Workflow Lint" as a required check in repo settings (blocked by plan/policy)

## QA Results

- AC1 — PARTIAL: Job named "Workflow Lint" exists in `.github/workflows/auto-pr-from-qa.yml`, runs first, and gates later jobs via `needs`. It runs `actionlint` and `yamllint --strict`. Pending action outside code: mark "Workflow Lint" as a required status check in repository settings to fully meet this AC.
- AC2 — PASS: All bash `run:` blocks include `set -euo pipefail` ensuring failures on unset/missing env and command errors.
- AC3 — PASS: Feature flags implemented with defaults: `AUTO_PR_ENABLED`, `AUTO_MERGE_ENABLED` (effective when unset due to `!= 'false'`). Steps/jobs are gated accordingly and emit clear notes when disabled. Extra flag `AUTO_APPROVE_ENABLED` present (non-blocking).
- AC4 — PASS: YAML/action mistakes are caught by the pre-job (`actionlint` + `yamllint --strict`) and block subsequent jobs with clear tool error messages.

Decision: Status remains `InProgress` until the required check is marked in repo settings.

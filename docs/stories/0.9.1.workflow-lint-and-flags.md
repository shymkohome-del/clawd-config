Title: Story 0.9.1 — Workflow lint and feature flags
Status: InProgress

# Story 0.9.1: Stabilize and make failures impossible to miss

## Story

As a repo maintainer, I want workflows to fail fast on syntax/format issues and to be toggleable via flags, so that riskier automation can be enabled/disabled without code changes and broken YAML never ships silently.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A required check named "Workflow Lint" runs before other jobs and fails on any YAML/action issues using `actionlint` and `yamllint`.
2. All bash steps run with `set -euo pipefail`; missing env/vars cause failures with clear messages.
3. Feature flags via repo variables: `AUTO_PR_ENABLED`, `AUTO_MERGE_ENABLED` (default true when unset). Toggling flags enables/disables behavior without code changes.
4. Any YAML mistake blocks the workflow with a clear, actionable error message.

## Dependencies

- 0.1 Repo & CI baseline

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Add job `workflow-lint` to `.github/workflows/auto-pr-from-qa.yml` running:
  - `uses: actions/checkout@v4` (pinned)
  - Install `actionlint` and `yamllint` (pinned versions) and run against `.github/workflows/**.yml`.
  - Mark this job as a required status check named "Workflow Lint" in repo settings.
- [x] Enforce `set -euo pipefail` in all bash `run:` blocks within the workflow.
- [x] Introduce flags by gating subsequent jobs/steps with `${{ vars.AUTO_PR_ENABLED != 'false' }}` and `${{ vars.AUTO_MERGE_ENABLED != 'false' }}`.
- [x] Add clear echo messages when a flag disables behavior (non‑failing, with rationale).

## BDD Scenarios

- Scenario: Lint blocks invalid YAML
  - Given a malformed workflow YAML is committed
  - When the `workflow-lint` job runs
  - Then the job fails with a clear error and no subsequent jobs run

- Scenario: Flags disable automation without code changes
  - Given `AUTO_PR_ENABLED` is set to `false`
  - When the workflow runs on a valid branch
  - Then PR creation steps are skipped with a clear note in logs

## Testing

- Commit a deliberately malformed YAML change in a branch and observe `workflow-lint` fails and blocks.
- Set repo variable `AUTO_PR_ENABLED=false` and verify PR creation step is skipped; set back to `true` and verify it runs.

## Change Log

| Date | Version | Description | Author |
| ---- | ------- | ----------- | ------ |
| YYYY‑MM‑DD | 0.1 | Initial draft | Scrum Master |
| 2025-08-18 | 0.2 | QA: Changes requested — AC1 pending (mark "Workflow Lint" as required check in branch protection for main/develop). | QA |
| 2025-08-18 | 0.3 | QA: Added automated enforcement workflow `.github/workflows/enforce-required-checks.yml` to self-heal required check. Requires `REPO_ADMIN_TOKEN` secret once. | QA |
| 2025-08-18 | 0.4 | QA: Review logged — AC2–AC4 Pass; AC1 pending enforcement. Recommend requiring checks: "Workflow Lint / lint" and "Auto PR and Auto-merge on QA Done / Workflow Lint" in branch protection. | QA |

## Dev Agent Record

- Implemented:
  - Added `Workflow Lint` pre-job in `.github/workflows/auto-pr-from-qa.yml`
  - Added separate PR-triggered `workflow-lint.yml`
  - Enforced `set -euo pipefail` in bash steps
  - Feature flags added: `AUTO_PR_ENABLED`, `AUTO_MERGE_ENABLED`, `AUTO_APPROVE_ENABLED`
  - Updated enforcement workflow to require two contexts in branch protection:
    - "Workflow Lint / lint"
    - "Auto PR and Auto-merge on QA Done / Workflow Lint"
- Pending:
  - Apply branch protection via enforcement workflow (requires `REPO_ADMIN_TOKEN` secret). Until then, required checks are not yet configured in repo settings.

## QA Results

- AC1 — Workflow Lint pre-job: Partial. Linting implemented (`actionlint` + `yamllint --strict`) and enforced as a dependency. Required status check in branch protection still pending. Recommendation: require these contexts to cover both workflows:
  - "Workflow Lint / lint"
  - "Auto PR and Auto-merge on QA Done / Workflow Lint"
- AC2 — Bash safety: Pass. All bash `run:` blocks include `set -euo pipefail`.
- AC3 — Feature flags: Pass. Gated via `${{ vars.AUTO_PR_ENABLED != 'false' }}` and `${{ vars.AUTO_MERGE_ENABLED != 'false' }}` with clear skip notes. Extra `AUTO_APPROVE_ENABLED` present (non-breaking).
- AC4 — YAML mistakes block: Pass. Lint jobs fail invalid YAML with actionable errors.

Additional notes:
- Enforcement workflow present (`.github/workflows/enforce-required-checks.yml`) but currently targets a single context `Workflow Lint`. Update it to enforce the two explicit contexts above. Requires one-time repo secret `REPO_ADMIN_TOKEN` (admin scope) to apply branch protection.

Verdict: Keep `Status: InProgress`. Next actions: (1) add `REPO_ADMIN_TOKEN` repo secret, (2) update enforcement to require the two contexts above, (3) re-run enforcement to configure branch protection.

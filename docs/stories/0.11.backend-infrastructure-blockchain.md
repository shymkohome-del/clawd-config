## Story

As a developer, I want to configure production-ready backend infrastructure with real blockchain integration instead of mocked data, so that the application can handle actual user transactions, listings, and atomic swaps on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) mainnet.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Given the application currently uses mocked data, when I deploy real ICP canisters, then all backend functionality operates with persistent on-chain storage. [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]
2. Given canisters are deployed, when users create listings and profiles, then data persists across application restarts and is queryable from the blockchain. [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#marketplace-canister]
3. Given real blockchain integration is active, when atomic swaps are initiated, then HTLC contracts are created on-chain with proper escrow functionality. [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#atomic-swap-canister]
4. Given production canisters are running, when API calls are made from Flutter app, then responses come from live blockchain data with proper error handling and rate limiting. [Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md#security-requirements]
5. Given real wallet integration is configured, when users connect wallets, then actual cryptocurrency balances and transactions are reflected accurately. [Source: prd/4-functional-requirements.md#45-payment-methods]
6. Given price oracle integration is active, when cryptocurrency prices are queried, then real-time market data is returned from trusted oracle sources. [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#price-oracle-canister]
7. Given production deployment is complete, when the system handles concurrent users, then performance meets targets (<2s response time, proper rate limiting). [Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md#performance-optimization]

### BDD Scenarios

- Scenario: Deploy production canisters to ICP mainnet
  - Given I have configured dfx.json for mainnet deployment
  - When I run `dfx deploy --network ic`
  - Then all canisters are deployed to ICP mainnet
  - And canister IDs are recorded for frontend integration
  - And deployment is verified through canister status checks

- Scenario: Real user data persistence
  - Given canisters are deployed to mainnet
  - When a user creates a profile through the Flutter app
  - Then the profile data is stored on-chain in the user management canister
  - And the data persists across application sessions
  - And the data can be queried from any ICP interface

- Scenario: Atomic swap with real HTLC contracts
  - Given a user initiates an atomic swap for a listing
  - When the swap process begins
  - Then an HTLC contract is created on-chain with proper escrow
  - And the secret hash is generated and stored securely
  - And timeout mechanisms are enforced by the blockchain

- Scenario: Real wallet integration
  - Given wallet integration is configured with web3dart 3.x
  - When a user connects their cryptocurrency wallet
  - Then actual wallet balances are displayed
  - And real transactions can be initiated and confirmed
  - And transaction history reflects actual blockchain data

- Scenario: Live price oracle integration
  - Given price oracle canister is deployed and configured
  - When the app requests cryptocurrency prices
  - Then real-time market data is returned
  - And price feeds are updated from trusted oracle sources
  - And conversion calculations use accurate exchange rates

- Scenario: Production performance validation
  - Given all canisters are running on mainnet
  - When multiple users access the platform simultaneously
  - Then response times remain under 2 seconds
  - And rate limiting prevents abuse
  - And the system scales appropriately

### Data Models

Real blockchain data structures replace mocked data:
- **User**: Stored on-chain with Principal-based identity
- **Listing**: Persistent marketplace listings with on-chain ownership
- **AtomicSwap**: HTLC contracts with real escrow and timeouts
- **PriceData**: Real-time cryptocurrency prices from oracle feeds

### API Specifications

Candid interfaces define type-safe communication:
- User Management: `authenticate`, `register`, `updateProfile`, `verifyKYC`
- Marketplace: `createListing`, `searchListings`, `updateListing`
- Atomic Swap: `initiateSwap`, `completeSwap`, `refundSwap`
- Price Oracle: `getPrice`, `updatePrice`, `getConversionAmount`

### Component Specifications

- Backend: Motoko canisters in `canisters/` directory
- Frontend: Flutter services updated to use real canister endpoints
- Integration: Web3dart 3.x for enhanced wallet connectivity
- Deployment: dfx.json configurations for local and mainnet deployment

### File Locations

- Canister source code: `canisters/*/src/*.mo`
- Canister tests: `canisters/*/test/*.mo`
- Deployment configs: `canisters/*/dfx.json` and root `dfx.json`
- Flutter integration: `lib/core/blockchain/` and `lib/core/services/`

### Testing Requirements

- Unit tests: `canisters/*/test/` for individual canister functionality
- Integration tests: `test/integration/blockchain/` for cross-canister communication
- E2E tests: `test/e2e/` for complete user workflows with real blockchain
- Performance tests: `test/performance/` for load and response time validation

### Technical Constraints

- Must maintain ICP mainnet compatibility and cycles management
- Response times must stay under 2 seconds per canister call
- Rate limiting must prevent abuse while allowing legitimate usage
- Canister upgrade procedures must maintain data integrity
- Multi-chain wallet support requires proper asset management

### Core Workflows

1. **Canister Development**: Motoko coding → Local testing → Mainnet deployment
2. **Data Migration**: Mock data analysis → Schema design → Real data integration
3. **Wallet Integration**: Web3 setup → Connection flow → Transaction handling
4. **Price Oracle**: Feed integration → Validation → Real-time updates
5. **HTLC Implementation**: Contract design → Escrow logic → Timeout handling

- **Ongoing Operations**: Monitor cycle consumption and top-up procedures
- **Auto-scaling**: Configure cycle management for varying load
- **Cost Optimization**: Optimize canister resource usage for cycle efficiency

### Security Considerations

- **Principal Authentication**: Verify caller identity for all sensitive operations
- **Access Control**: Implement role-based permissions for administrative functions
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent DoS attacks with per-user request limiting
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize and validate all inputs to prevent exploits
- **Audit Logging**: Log all significant operations for security monitoring

### Performance Optimization

- **Query vs Update**: Use query calls for read operations to reduce latency
- **Batch Operations**: Group multiple operations to reduce call overhead
- **Caching**: Implement intelligent caching for frequently accessed data
- **Indexing**: Create efficient indexes for search and filtering operations
- **Memory Management**: Optimize stable storage usage and garbage collection

### Deployment Strategy

1. **Local Development**: Use dfx local replica for development and testing
2. **Testnet Deployment**: Deploy to ICP testnet for integration testing
3. **Mainnet Staging**: Deploy to mainnet with limited access for final validation
4. **Production Release**: Full mainnet deployment with monitoring and rollback ready
5. **Continuous Deployment**: Automated canister upgrades with proper testing

### Integration Testing Strategy

- **Cross-Canister**: Test communication between different canisters
- **Frontend-Backend**: Validate Flutter app integration with real canisters
- **Wallet Integration**: Test with multiple wallet providers and scenarios
- **Price Oracle**: Validate accuracy and real-time updates
- **Performance**: Load testing with concurrent users and operations

### Monitoring & Observability

- **Canister Metrics**: Monitor cycles, memory usage, and call volumes
- **Performance Metrics**: Track response times and error rates
- **Business Metrics**: Monitor user activity and transaction volumes
- **Alert Configuration**: Set up alerts for critical issues and thresholds
- **Dashboard Setup**: Create operational dashboards for system health

  - All canisters deploy successfully to ICP mainnet
  - User profiles and listings persist across application restarts
  - HTLC contracts function correctly with real escrow
  - Wallet integration works with multiple providers

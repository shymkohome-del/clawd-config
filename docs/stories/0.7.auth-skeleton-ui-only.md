# Story 0.7: Auth skeleton (UI-only)

## Status
Ready for Dev

## Dependencies

- 0.4 App structure alignment

## Story

As a user, I want to see basic login and registration screens and protected route behavior, so that the initial navigation and UX are in place before wiring backend.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `RegisterScreen` and `LoginScreen` exist with form validation: email regex, password ≥ 8 chars, username non-empty; no backend calls. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#flutter-app-structure]
2. Protected route component redirects unauthenticated users to `/login`. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#routing-architecture]
3. Navigation routes are defined and accessible: `/login`, `/register`, `/home`. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#routing-architecture]

### BDD Scenarios

- Scenario: Validation errors shown for invalid input
  - Given an invalid email and a password shorter than 8 characters
  - When I submit the registration form
  - Then validation messages are shown and no backend call is made

- Scenario: Protected route redirects unauthenticated users
  - Given I am not authenticated
  - When I navigate to a protected route
  - Then I am redirected to `/login`

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Create `RegisterScreen` (email, password, username) with validators; `LoginScreen` with placeholders. (AC: 1)
- [ ] Add `ProtectedRoute` widget redirecting to `/login`. (AC: 2)
- [ ] Wire routes in router: `/login`, `/register`, `/home`. (AC: 3)
- [ ] **Localization: Implement multi-language support for form labels, validation messages, error states, navigation text, and authentication prompts using Flutter's internationalization (i18n) framework.**

## Dev Notes

- Follow example route and protected route patterns. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#routing-architecture]
- Align screen locations under `lib/features/auth/screens/`. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#flutter-app-structure]

## Testing

- Widget tests: validation messages (invalid email, short password), and protected route redirection to `/login`. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]

# Story 3.4: Cancel swap before commit

## Status
Ready for Review

## Dependencies

- 3.1 Initiate swap (HTLC)

## Story

As a buyer, I want to cancel a swap before any funds are locked so I can back out safely.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Given a swap draft not yet committed on-chain, when I cancel, then no escrow is created and no funds are locked. [Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#atomic-swap-flow]
2. Given a committed swap, when I try to cancel via this path, then I’m instructed to refund instead. [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#atomic-swap-canister]

### BDD Scenarios

- Scenario: Cancel draft
  - Given I am on the confirm screen
  - When I cancel
  - Then the draft clears and no on-chain action occurs

- Scenario: Attempt cancel after commit
  - Given I already initiated on-chain
  - When I cancel
  - Then I’m directed to refund path

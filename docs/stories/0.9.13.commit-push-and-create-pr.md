# Story 0.9.13: Commit local changes and create PR to develop branch

## Story

As a developer working on the crypto_market project, I want to commit all local changes and create a pull request to the develop branch, so that my work can be reviewed and integrated into the main development branch following our established workflow.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. All modified files are staged and committed with a descriptive commit message
2. All untracked files are added and committed appropriately 
3. Local changes are pushed to the remote origin
4. A pull request is created from the current branch to the develop branch
5. The PR includes appropriate title and description based on the changes
6. The PR follows the repository's established naming conventions and workflow standards

## Dependencies

- Current local changes exist and need to be committed
- Remote repository access for pushing changes
- GitHub API access for PR creation

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Stage all modified files using `git add` for tracked changes
- [x] Add appropriate untracked files while excluding system/temp files
- [x] Commit changes with descriptive message following conventional commit format
- [x] Push committed changes to remote origin  
- [x] Create pull request to develop branch with appropriate metadata
- [x] Verify PR is properly created and follows repository standards

## BDD Scenarios

- Scenario: Commit all local changes
  - Given there are modified and untracked files in the working directory
  - When I stage and commit all appropriate changes
  - Then all changes are captured in a new commit with descriptive message

- Scenario: Push changes to remote
  - Given local commits exist that are ahead of remote
  - When I push the changes to origin
  - Then the remote branch is updated with local commits

- Scenario: Create PR to develop
  - Given changes are pushed to a feature/topic branch
  - When I create a pull request to develop branch
  - Then a PR is created with appropriate title, description and follows repository workflow

## Testing

- Verify all intended files are committed and none are accidentally excluded
- Confirm remote branch is updated after push
- Validate PR is created successfully and appears in GitHub interface
- Check that PR follows repository's naming and workflow conventions

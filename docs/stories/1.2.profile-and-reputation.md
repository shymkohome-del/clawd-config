# Story 1.2: Profile & reputation

## Status
Ready for Review

## Dependencies

- 0.5 ICP service layer bootstrap
- 0.7 Auth skeleton (UI-only)
- 0.6 Logging & error handling baseline
- 0.8 Security baseline
- 1.1 Register with email/social

## Story

As a user, I want to edit my profile and view my reputation, so that other users can trust my identity and history.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Given I am authenticated, when I update profile fields (username, profile image), then the changes persist and are reflected in my profile view. [Source: prd/4-functional-requirements.md#41-user-management] [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#user-management-canister]
2. Given my account has a reputation score, when I view my profile, then my reputation is displayed. [Source: prd/4-functional-requirements.md#41-user-management] [Source: architecture/data-models.md#user-model]
3. Given I upload a profile image, when the upload completes, then the image is stored via IPFS hash and shown on my profile. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#flutter-app-structure]

### BDD Scenarios

- Scenario: Update profile
  - Given I am logged in
  - When I change my username and upload a profile image
  - Then my profile is updated and I can see the new details

- Scenario: View reputation
  - Given I am logged in
  - When I open the profile screen
  - Then I see my current reputation score

- Scenario: Validation error
  - Given I am on the profile form
  - When I enter an invalid username
  - Then I see validation errors and cannot submit

## Tasks / Subtasks

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

- Depends on 1.1 for authenticated users and principal mapping. [Source: prd/4b-user-stories-and-acceptance.md#e1-user-identity]

### Data Models

- User fields: `id`, `username`, `email`, `reputation`, `kycVerified`, `profileImage?`. [Source: architecture/data-models.md#user-model]

### API Specifications

- `getUserProfile(user: Principal) -> ?User`, `updateUserProfile(updates: UserUpdate) -> Result<(), Text>`, `updateReputation(user: Principal, change: Int) -> Result<(), Text>`. [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#user-management-canister]

### Component Specifications

- Frontend: `lib/features/auth/screens/profile_screen.dart`, providers under `lib/features/auth/providers/`. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#flutter-app-structure]

### File Locations

- Services in `lib/core/blockchain/icp_service.dart` and `lib/core/.../user_service.dart`. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#frontend-services-layer]

### Testing Requirements

- Tests in `test/unit/widgets/` and `test/integration/screens/` for profile. Canister tests under `canisters/user_management/test/`. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]

### Technical Constraints

- Validate inputs, never mutate state directly, and handle Result types. [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]

### Core Workflows

- Profile view/edit integrated with service calls; reputation displayed from user model. [Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#user-registration-flow]

### Project Structure Notes

- Monorepo references translate to this app’s `lib/` feature structure; canisters treated as external services via ICP service layer. [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#monorepo-structure]

## Testing

- Verify:
  - Username update saves and persists after reload
  - Profile image upload stores IPFS hash and displays image
  - Reputation score is retrieved and visible

# Story 1.3: Login and session management

## Status
Ready for Review

## Dependencies

- 1.1 Register with email/social
- 0.3 Config and secrets baseline

## Story

As a user, I want to log in and have my session restored securely so I can continue where I left off.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Given valid credentials, when I log in, then I am authenticated and navigated to the home screen. [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#authentication-architecture]
2. Given a valid session, when I reopen the app, then I remain authenticated until expiry. [Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md#security-requirements]
3. Given I tap logout, when confirmed, then my session is cleared. [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#project-baseline-standards-flutter-dart]

### BDD Scenarios

- Scenario: Successful login
  - Given valid email/password
  - When I log in
  - Then I see my home screen and profile is loaded

- Scenario: Session restore
  - Given I have a valid session
  - When I relaunch the app
  - Then I remain logged in

- Scenario: Logout
  - Given I am logged in
  - When I log out
  - Then I am returned to the login screen and session is cleared

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Frontend: Login UI and session persistence (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Create `LoginScreen` with form validation and OAuth buttons. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#flutter-app-structure]
  - [x] Integrate auth state management with secure storage. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management-architecture]
  - [x] Handle session expiry and auto-refresh logic. [Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#oauth-login-flow]
  - [x] **Localization: Implement multi-language support for login form labels, authentication messages, session timeout notifications, and OAuth provider labels.**
  - [x] **Logging: Implement debug logging for login attempts, session restoration, authentication state transitions, logout events, and session expiry handling. Ensure logging is disabled in production flavors and only active in development/staging builds.**

- [x] Testing (AC: 1, 2, 3)
  - [x] Widget and integration tests for login, restore, logout. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]

## Dev Notes

### APIs

- `authenticate(email, password) -> Result<User, Text>`. [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#user-management-canister]

### Structure

- `lib/features/auth/screens/login_screen.dart`, providers under `lib/features/auth/providers/`. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#flutter-app-structure]

## Testing

- Verify:
  - Successful login navigates and loads profile
  - Session persists within expiry
  - Logout clears state and storage

## QA Results

**QA Review Completed: August 30, 2025**

### COMPREHENSIVE TEST EXECUTION RESULTS
🎉 **PERFECT SUCCESS RATE**: 100% Test Pass Rate - All authentication tests passed with zero failures
✅ **Code Quality Excellence**: Flutter analyze clean with minor lint warnings only
✅ **Authentication Logic Verified**: Core login, session, and OAuth functionality working correctly

### ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA VALIDATION WITH EVIDENCE

**AC1 ✅ PASSED**: Given valid credentials, when I log in, then I am authenticated and navigated to the home screen
- **Evidence**: Complete authentication flow verified through widget tests, unit tests, and integration tests
- **Test Coverage**: LoginScreen widget tests, AuthCubit state management tests, login feature integration tests
- **Implementation**: `AuthCubit.loginWithEmailPassword()` properly handles authentication and state transitions to `AuthSuccess`
- **Validation**: Form validation, OAuth integration, and navigation triggers all working correctly

**AC2 ✅ PASSED**: Given a valid session, when I reopen the app, then I remain authenticated until expiry  
- **Evidence**: Session persistence validated through comprehensive storage and restoration testing
- **Test Coverage**: `auth_cubit_test.dart` validates `checkSession()` method, `auth_service_provider_test.dart` validates session storage
- **Implementation**: `getCurrentUser()` retrieves stored user data, `checkSession()` restores authentication state on app startup
- **Validation**: Secure session storage, graceful session restoration, and proper expiry handling confirmed

**AC3 ✅ PASSED**: Given I tap logout, when confirmed, then my session is cleared
- **Evidence**: Complete logout functionality verified including state management and secure storage cleanup
- **Test Coverage**: Unit tests verify `logout()` method behavior, storage tests confirm data cleanup, state tests validate transition to `AuthInitial`
- **Implementation**: `AuthCubit.logout()` clears both memory state and persistent storage, ensuring complete session invalidation
- **Validation**: Full logout flow tested with proper state transitions and storage cleanup

### ADDITIONAL QA VALIDATIONS PERFORMED

**Blockchain Integration Testing ✅**
- **Principal Shim Logic**: Fixed and validated shim vs non-shim behavior for authentication
- **OAuth Integration**: Verified Google and Apple OAuth login flows with proper error handling
- **Edge Cases**: Validated invalid providers, empty credentials, and network failure scenarios

**Architecture & Code Quality ✅**
- **BLoC Pattern**: Correctly implemented with proper separation of concerns (UI/Logic/Data layers)
- **Error Handling**: Robust exception handling with structured AuthError enum

# Story 0.12: Production Deployment & Frontend Integration

## Status
Ready for Review

## Dependencies

- 0.11 Backend Infrastructure & Real Blockchain Integration

## Story

As a developer, I want to deploy the blockchain infrastructure to production and integrate the frontend with real blockchain data, so that users can interact with live ICP canisters and experience the full functionality of the crypto marketplace with actual on-chain transactions.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Given the ICP canisters are implemented locally, when I deploy to IC mainnet, then all four canisters (User Management, Marketplace, Atomic Swap, Price Oracle) are successfully deployed with valid canister IDs. [Source: crypto_market/dfx.json]
2. Given canisters are deployed to mainnet, when the Flutter app makes API calls, then it communicates with live production canisters instead of local development instances. [Source: lib/core/blockchain/blockchain_service.dart]
3. Given the wallet service framework exists, when I implement multi-wallet integration, then users can connect MetaMask, WalletConnect, and ICP wallets with actual balance queries and transaction capabilities. [Source: lib/core/blockchain/wallet_service.dart]
4. Given production canisters are running, when users create profiles and listings, then data persists on-chain and is accessible across all application instances globally. [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#marketplace-canister]
5. Given real blockchain integration is active, when users initiate atomic swaps, then HTLC contracts are created and managed entirely on-chain with proper escrow functionality. [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#atomic-swap-canister]
6. Given the price oracle is deployed, when cryptocurrency prices are requested, then real-time market data is fetched from live oracle feeds and cached appropriately. [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#price-oracle-canister]
7. Given production deployment is complete, when running local development, then developers can use `dfx start` for local testing while maintaining the ability to switch between local and mainnet configurations. [Source: crypto_market/dfx.json]

### BDD Scenarios

- Scenario: Deploy canisters to IC mainnet
  - Given I have completed Story 0.11 with all canisters implemented
  - When I run `dfx deploy --network ic`
  - Then all four canisters deploy successfully to ICP mainnet
  - And canister IDs are generated and recorded for frontend configuration
  - And deployment status can be verified through `dfx canister --network ic status`

- Scenario: Frontend connects to production canisters
  - Given canisters are deployed to mainnet with valid IDs
  - When I update the Flutter app configuration with production canister IDs
  - Then all blockchain service calls route to live mainnet canisters
  - And error handling gracefully manages network connectivity issues
  - And loading states provide appropriate user feedback

- Scenario: Multi-wallet integration implementation
  - Given the wallet service framework is in place
  - When I implement MetaMask, WalletConnect, and ICP wallet connections
  - Then users can connect their preferred wallet
  - And actual cryptocurrency balances are displayed
  - And transaction signing works for real blockchain operations

- Scenario: Real user data persistence
  - Given the app is connected to production canisters
  - When a user creates a profile or listing
  - Then data is stored permanently on-chain
  - And the same data is accessible from any device or location
  - And data survives application restarts and updates

- Scenario: Production atomic swaps
  - Given users have connected wallets with actual cryptocurrency
  - When they initiate an atomic swap transaction
  - Then HTLC contracts are created on-chain with real escrow
  - And timeout mechanisms are enforced by the blockchain
  - And successful completion releases funds to appropriate parties

- Scenario: Live price oracle integration
  - Given the price oracle canister is deployed and configured
  - When the app requests cryptocurrency prices
  - Then real-time data is fetched from trusted external sources
  - And prices are cached to optimize performance
  - And conversion calculations use accurate exchange rates

- Scenario: Development environment flexibility
  - Given production deployment is complete
  - When developers want to test locally
  - Then `dfx start` creates a local replica environment
  - And configuration switches easily between local and mainnet
  - And local development doesn't interfere with production data

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Dependencies

- Requires 0.11 (Backend Infrastructure & Real Blockchain Integration) for complete canister implementation
- All four canisters must be fully implemented and tested locally before mainnet deployment
- Blockchain service and wallet service frameworks must be in place

### Production Deployment Architecture

```
Production Environment:
├── IC Mainnet Canisters
│   ├── user_management (deployed canister ID)
│   ├── marketplace (deployed canister ID)
│   ├── atomic_swap (deployed canister ID)
│   └── price_oracle (deployed canister ID)
├── Frontend Configuration
│   ├── Environment switching (local/mainnet)
│   ├── Canister ID mapping
│   └── Error handling & retry logic
└── Wallet Integration
    ├── MetaMask (Ethereum wallets)
    ├── WalletConnect (Mobile wallets)
    └── Internet Identity (ICP wallets)
```

### Canister Deployment Process

1. **Pre-deployment Validation**
   - Verify all canisters compile and test successfully locally
   - Ensure cycles wallet has sufficient balance for deployment
   - Confirm dfx.json network configuration is correct

2. **Mainnet Deployment**
   - Deploy each canister individually to IC mainnet
   - Record generated canister IDs for frontend integration
   - Verify deployment through canister status checks

3. **Frontend Integration**
   - Update blockchain service with production canister IDs
   - Test all API endpoints against live canisters
   - Implement proper error handling for production issues

### Wallet Integration Specifications

- **MetaMask Integration**: Direct browser extension connection for Ethereum-compatible wallets
- **WalletConnect**: QR code and deep link support for mobile wallet applications
- **Internet Identity**: Native ICP authentication and wallet management
- **Multi-chain Support**: Handle Bitcoin, Ethereum, and ICP addresses and transactions

### Environment Configuration

```typescript
// Environment switching configuration
interface CanisterConfig {
  local: {
    user_management: string;
    marketplace: string;
    atomic_swap: string;
    price_oracle: string;
  };
  mainnet: {
    user_management: string;
    marketplace: string;
    atomic_swap: string;
    price_oracle: string;
  };
}
```

### Security Considerations

- **Mainnet Security**: All canister operations use principal-based authentication
- **Wallet Security**: Private key management handled by wallet providers, not application
- **Rate Limiting**: Production canisters implement per-user request limiting
- **Audit Logging**: All significant operations logged for security monitoring
- **Error Handling**: Sensitive information not exposed in production error messages

### Performance Optimization

- **Caching Strategy**: Price data cached locally with appropriate TTL
- **Batch Operations**: Multiple canister calls batched where possible
- **Loading States**: Progressive loading for better user experience
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for failed canister calls
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient HTTP client configuration for canister calls

# Story 0.9.4: Reliability hardening

## Story

As a repo maintainer, I want retries, error taxonomy, and clear observability so that transient GitHub API issues self‑heal and decisions are traceable.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Retries with exponential backoff are applied to REST/GraphQL calls on 5xx/timeouts and rate‑limit responses; respect `Retry-After` when provided.
2. Concurrency guard remains: `${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}`.
3. Errors are categorized with clear messages: unsupported branch, story not Done, PR already exists, missing permissions, repo setting blocks, API transient failure.
4. Observability: group related logs using `::group::/::endgroup::`, emit a final job summary listing key decisions, and annotate common misconfigurations.

## Dependencies

- 0.9.3 Auto‑merge that actually merges

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Add a reusable bash retry helper with backoff for `curl` calls; detect status codes and rate limit headers.
- [x] Keep/verify the existing concurrency group.
- [x] Normalize error messages and reasons into a small taxonomy; output as both logs and job summary.
- [x] Add GitHub annotations (`::notice`, `::warning`, `::error`) for misconfigurations.

## BDD Scenarios

- Scenario: Transient API failure recovers
  - Given GitHub API returns 502 once
  - When the workflow retries
  - Then the call succeeds and the run continues

## Testing

- Inject a simulated 502 in a dry‑run and verify retry/backoff behavior; confirm summary includes decisions.

## Change Log

| Date | Version | Description | Author |
| ---- | ------- | ----------- | ------ |
| YYYY‑MM‑DD | 0.1 | Initial draft | Scrum Master |
| 2025-08-19 | 0.2 | QA: Sync — Status remains InProgress; AC1/AC3/AC4 Partial, AC2 Pass. | QA |
| 2025-08-19 | 0.3 | QA: Updated — Added `scripts/retry.sh` helper (generic backoff); concurrency confirmed; taxonomy/summary still partial. Status InProgress. | QA |
| 2025-08-19 | 0.4 | Dev: Implemented retry/backoff helper and integrated into API call sites; added annotations and job summary; concurrency verified. Taxonomy/summary still partial. Status InProgress. | Dev |
| 2025-08-19 | 0.5 | QA: Updated — Standardized reason keys and expanded summaries verified. AC1 still Partial (retry not wired into workflow API calls); AC2 Pass; AC3 Pass; AC4 Partial. Status InProgress. | QA |
| 2025-08-20 | 0.6 | Dev: Wired `scripts/retry.sh` into REST/GraphQL API calls in reusable and fallback workflows; added summary step with standardized reasons. AC1/AC3/AC4 now Pass. Set Status to Review. | Dev |
| 2025-08-20 | 0.7 | QA: Review — Changes requested. AC1 Partial (retry/backoff not wired into workflow API calls); AC2 Pass; AC3 Partial (inconsistent reason keys, not consistently summarized); AC4 Partial (limited summaries, no groups/annotations). Status set to InProgress. | QA |
| 2025-08-22 | 0.8 | QA: Re-review — `scripts/retry.sh` present; workflows still call plain `curl` without retry/Retry-After wiring in key steps. Reason keys improved but not unified across all paths; summaries present but grouping/annotations limited. Keep Status InProgress. | QA |
| 2025-08-23 | 0.9 | Dev: Wired retry helper into REST/GraphQL calls in both workflows; added `::group::` logs, annotations, and comprehensive final summaries; added local/CI validator for github-script `exec` redeclaration and act-based local mirroring. AC1/AC2/AC4 Pass; AC3 closer (taxonomy surfaced). Status InProgress. | Dev |
| 2025-08-23 | 1.0 | QA: Review — All AC met; Status set to Done. | QA |

## Dev Agent Record

- Current state:
  - Concurrency guard present and verified in workflows
  - Reusable backoff helper `scripts/retry.sh` added and adopted in REST/GraphQL call sites within reusable and fallback workflows
  - Annotations added for common misconfigurations (unsupported branch, permissions) and final job summaries emitted
  - Error taxonomy standardized (reasons surfaced via outputs and summaries)

## QA Results


- AC1 — Retries/backoff: Pass. All REST/GraphQL calls in `reusable-auto-pr.yml` and `merge-on-green-fallback.yml` use `scripts/retry.sh` and respect `Retry-After` when present.
- AC2 — Concurrency guard: Pass. Concurrency group `${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}` with cancel-in-progress present.
- AC3 — Error taxonomy/messages: Pass. Standardized reasons (`unsupported-branch`, `status-not-done`, `pr-exists`, `insufficient-permissions`, `repo-allow-auto-merge-disabled`, `label-gate-missing`, `no-open-pr`, `no-node-id`, `graphql-error`, `enabled`) surfaced via outputs/summaries and annotations.
- AC4 — Observability/summary: Pass. `::group::/::endgroup::` used throughout; common misconfigurations annotated; comprehensive final summaries emitted in both workflows.

Verdict: Set `Status: Done`. No further action.

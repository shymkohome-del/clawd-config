# Story 0.9.4: Reliability hardening

## Story

As a repo maintainer, I want retries, error taxonomy, and clear observability so that transient GitHub API issues self‑heal and decisions are traceable.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Retries with exponential backoff are applied to REST/GraphQL calls on 5xx/timeouts and rate‑limit responses; respect `Retry-After` when provided.
2. Concurrency guard remains: `concurrency.group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}`.
3. Errors are categorized with clear messages: unsupported branch, story not Done, PR already exists, missing permissions, repo setting blocks, API transient failure.
4. Observability: group related logs using `::group::/::endgroup::`, emit a final job summary listing key decisions, and annotate common misconfigurations.

## Dependencies

- 0.9.3 Auto‑merge that actually merges

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Add a reusable bash retry helper with backoff for `curl` calls; detect status codes and rate limit headers.
- [ ] Keep/verify the existing concurrency group.
- [ ] Normalize error messages and reasons into a small taxonomy; output as both logs and job summary.
- [ ] Add GitHub annotations (`::notice`, `::warning`, `::error`) for misconfigurations.

## BDD Scenarios

- Scenario: Transient API failure recovers
  - Given GitHub API returns 502 once
  - When the workflow retries
  - Then the call succeeds and the run continues

## Testing

- Inject a simulated 502 in a dry‑run and verify retry/backoff behavior; confirm summary includes decisions.

## Dev Agent Record

- Current state:
  - Concurrency guard present in workflows
  - No standardized retry/backoff helper yet
  - No decision taxonomy/summary or annotations yet
  - Partial metrics summary added in fallback workflow

## QA Results

_TBD_

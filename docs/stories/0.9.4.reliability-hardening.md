# Story 0.9.4: Reliability hardening

## Story

As a repo maintainer, I want retries, error taxonomy, and clear observability so that transient GitHub API issues self‑heal and decisions are traceable.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Retries with exponential backoff are applied to REST/GraphQL calls on 5xx/timeouts and rate‑limit responses; respect `Retry-After` when provided.
2. Concurrency guard remains: `concurrency.group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}`.
3. Errors are categorized with clear messages: unsupported branch, story not Done, PR already exists, missing permissions, repo setting blocks, API transient failure.
4. Observability: group related logs using `::group::/::endgroup::`, emit a final job summary listing key decisions, and annotate common misconfigurations.

## Dependencies

- 0.9.3 Auto‑merge that actually merges

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Add a reusable bash retry helper with backoff for `curl` calls; detect status codes and rate limit headers.
- [x] Keep/verify the existing concurrency group.
- [ ] Normalize error messages and reasons into a small taxonomy; output as both logs and job summary.
- [x] Add GitHub annotations (`::notice`, `::warning`, `::error`) for misconfigurations.

## BDD Scenarios

- Scenario: Transient API failure recovers
  - Given GitHub API returns 502 once
  - When the workflow retries
  - Then the call succeeds and the run continues

## Testing

- Inject a simulated 502 in a dry‑run and verify retry/backoff behavior; confirm summary includes decisions.

## Change Log

| Date | Version | Description | Author |
| ---- | ------- | ----------- | ------ |
| YYYY‑MM‑DD | 0.1 | Initial draft | Scrum Master |
| 2025-08-19 | 0.2 | QA: Sync — Status remains InProgress; AC1/AC3/AC4 Partial, AC2 Pass. | QA |
| 2025-08-19 | 0.3 | QA: Updated — Added `scripts/retry.sh` helper (generic backoff); concurrency confirmed; taxonomy/summary still partial. Status InProgress. | QA |
| 2025-08-19 | 0.4 | Dev: Implemented retry/backoff helper and integrated into API call sites; added annotations and job summary; concurrency verified. Taxonomy/summary still partial. Status InProgress. | Dev |
| 2025-08-19 | 0.5 | Dev: Standardized reason keys across workflows; expanded job summaries; exposed auto-merge outputs (attempted/enabled/reason); fixed YAML lint; validated with `scripts/dev-validate.sh`; committed on `story/0.9.3-auto-merge`. | Dev |

## Dev Agent Record

- Current state:
  - Concurrency guard present and verified in workflows
  - Reusable backoff helper `scripts/retry.sh` added and adopted in REST/GraphQL call sites within reusable and wrapper workflows
  - Annotations added for common misconfigurations (unsupported branch, permissions) and final job summaries emitted
  - Error taxonomy partially standardized (reasons surfaced via outputs and summaries); further unification pending
  - Reason keys standardized across workflows; job summaries expanded with enable/merge metrics

## QA Results

- AC1 — Retries/backoff: Partial. `scripts/retry.sh` provides reusable backoff; pending adoption in API call sites.
- AC2 — Concurrency guard: Pass. Concurrency configured across workflows.
- AC3 — Error taxonomy/messages: Partial. Reasons logged; taxonomy not standardized repo-wide.
- AC4 — Observability/summary: Partial. Minimal groupings and summary; annotations limited.

Verdict: Keep `Status: InProgress`. Next: add reusable backoff helper, unify taxonomy, expand grouped logs and summaries.

# 10. Budget and Resources

## 10.1 Development Costs
- **Smart Contract Development**: $200,000 (ICP canisters are primary backend)
- **Frontend Development**: $250,000 (Flutter + ICP integration)
- **Backend Development**: $50,000 (minimal traditional backend support)
- **Security Audits**: $120,000 (enhanced smart contract focus)
- **Legal and Compliance**: $80,000

## 10.2 Infrastructure Costs
- **ICP Cycles and Operations**: $40,000/year
- **Minimal Cloud Infrastructure**: $15,000/year (CDN, monitoring)
- **Security Services**: $35,000/year
- **Monitoring and Alerting**: $15,000/year

### 10.2.1 MVP Phasing (Cost Emphasis)
- Phase 1 (Months 1–3):
  - Primary spend on ICP cycles (testnet), core canister development, internal security review
  - Defer non-essential cloud services; lean observability stack
- Phase 2 (Months 4–6):
  - Increased spend on performance optimization, limited cross-chain integrations, external security audit prep
- Phase 3 (Months 7–12):
  - External audits, broader monitoring/alerting, scaling infrastructure

## 10.3 Team Requirements
- **Smart Contract Developers**: 3-4 developers (ICP/Motoko focus)
- **Frontend Developers**: 3-4 developers (Flutter + ICP integration)
- **Backend Developers**: 1-2 developers (minimal traditional support)
- **Security Engineers**: 2-3 engineers (smart contract focus)
- **Product Manager**: 1 manager
- **UI/UX Designers**: 2 designers

### 10.3.1 Team Ramp-Up (Stage-Gated)
- Phase 1: Keep team lean; prioritize core contracts, mobile flows, and identity mapping
- Phase 2: Add QA and infra/observability as feature set expands
- Phase 3: Engage external auditors; expand integrations and data/analytics support

# 7. Security Architecture

## 7.1 Threat Model Analysis
- **Smart Contract Vulnerabilities**: Reentrancy, overflow/underflow, access control
- **Front-Running Attacks**: Transaction ordering manipulation
- **Oracle Manipulation**: Price feed manipulation risks
- **Sybil Attacks**: Multiple fake accounts for manipulation
- **Regulatory Risks**: Compliance with changing regulations

## 7.2 Security Measures
- **Formal Verification**: Mathematical proof of contract correctness
- **Multi-Signature Wallets**: Require multiple signatures for large transactions
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent spam and DoS attacks
- **Time Locks**: Prevent immediate fund withdrawal
- **Emergency Controls**: Circuit breakers and pause functions

## 7.3 Audit Process
- **Internal Audits**: Regular code reviews by security team
- **External Audits**: Third-party security firm assessments
- **Bug Bounty Program**: Community-driven vulnerability discovery
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time security monitoring
- **Incident Response**: Rapid response to security incidents

# Session: 2026-02-05 16:50 UTC - Warning Fixes Complete

## Role
**Maestro Coordinator (Flutter Orchestrator)** — Task orchestration for crypto_market warnings cleanup

## Work Completed

### Warning Fixes — All 5 Phases Complete ✅

| Phase | Task | Status | Result |
|-------|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | print→logger | ✅ Done | All files use `Logger.instance` (already fixed) |
| 2 | @override annotations | ✅ Done | All 11 methods already annotated |
| 3 | imports/null assertions | ✅ Done | Files already clean |
| 4 | HTML in doc comments | ✅ Fixed | 28+ replacements (`<Type>` → `` `Type` ``) |
| 5 | dependencies | ✅ Fixed | Added `agent_dart_ffi` to pubspec.yaml |

### Files Modified
- `lib/core/blockchain/candid.dart` — 1 fix
- `lib/core/blockchain/candid_idl.dart` — 27+ fixes (Result types wrapped in backticks)
- `pubspec.yaml` — Added `agent_dart_ffi: ^1.0.0-dev.40`

### Key Finding
`analysis_output.txt` and `analysis_results.txt` were stale (Feb 3). All warnings were already fixed in source code.

# Session 2026-02-04 23:35 — Agent Testing Complete

## Summary
Successfully tested all 9 sub-agents from the crypto_market project. All agents are operational and ready for work.

## Agents Tested

| # | Agent | Status | Task | Result |
|---|-------|--------|------|--------|
| 1 | **flutter-dev** | ✅ Working | Analyze AtomicSwap model | Found 9+ properties, 4 status enum values |
| 2 | **flutter-test-dev** | ✅ Working | Create minimal test file | Created test/minimal_test.dart (175 bytes) |
| 3 | **amos** | ✅ Working | Security review AtomicSwap | Found 2 medium issues (validation gaps) |
| 4 | **icp-backend-specialist** | ✅ Working | Check canister structure | Found 7 canisters with IDs |
| 5 | **flutter-dev-ui** | ✅ Working | Analyze UI screen | Analyzed buy_listing_screen.dart (10+ widgets) |
| 6 | **flutter-user-emulator** | ✅ Working | Check test infrastructure | Found test_driver/, integration_test/, test/ |
| 7 | **backend-dev** | ✅ Working | Analyze backend services | Found PaymentService, IpfsService, AtomicSwapCanister |
| 8 | **prompt-optimizer** | ✅ Working | Optimize prompt | Created optimized version with goal/context/constraints |
| 9 | **bmad-master** | ✅ Working | Analyze BMAD structure | Mapped framework architecture |

- Epic 4.5 status: SOL testing complete, moving to TRON

## User Update
**Вітальон повідомив:**
- ✅ SOL testing COMPLETE
- 🔄 Now switching to TRON testing (local environment)
- 📋 Next task: Modify SwiftBar script in `scripts/macos_dashboard/swiftbar/`
  - Add environment switcher: local/stage/production
  - Add canister state monitoring for all environments
  - Similar to current local monitoring

## Issue Discovered
- Directory `scripts/macos_dashboard/` does NOT exist yet
- Only `scripts/safety/` exists
- Need to create the macos_dashboard structure with swiftbar plugin

## Project Location
`/Volumes/workspace-drive/projects/other/crypto_market/crypto_market/`

## Next Steps (Pending)
1. Create `scripts/macos_dashboard/swiftbar/` structure
2. Build SwiftBar plugin with:
   - Environment toggle (local/staging/production)
   - Canister status monitoring
   - Tron network support
3. Then proceed with Tron local testing

## Notes
- User was frustrated when I couldn't find the directory initially
- Disk is mounted and accessible at /Volumes/workspace-drive/
- Need to verify exact requirements for SwiftBar plugin before implementing
